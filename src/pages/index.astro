      <div class="nudge-left">
        <h5 class="upper left">do you only offer painting services?</h5>

        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">i need exterior painting services, can you provide a free estimate?</h5>
        <p>
          Absolutely, we provide all our customers with free estimates. Get in touch with us by calling us or submitting
          the contact form and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">How long have you been in business?</h5>
        <p>
          As a Kansas City painting company we've been in business for over 10 years. However as painting professionals
          we've been in the painting industry for over 15 years.
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">are all painting companies the same in kansas City, MO?</h5>
        <p>
          No, not all painting companies are the same in Kansas City. On a major project like new exterior paint,
          interview several local professional painters and make sure you are present when they come to estimate your
          project. Look for attention to detail, ask about their painting process and ask if you can drive by some of
          their other jobs to see their work, and always check out the credentials (insurance, online reviews, website,
          warranty, etc…).
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left ow">how long does a house painting project take?</h5>
        <p>
          On average homes we paint take 3.5 days. Small, 1 level homes can be quicker and take 2, depending on the
          condition they’re in. Large multi level homes with lots of trim and prep work (such as those in Westport or
          Brookside) can take 1 to 2 weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The time it will take to finish the job will depend on the condition your home is in, your expectations and
          needs, and the size of your house. Our estimator will be able to give you a good approximation of the time it
          will take to paint your home after meeting with you.
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">do you spray, spray and backroll, or brush and roll the paint?</h5>
        <p>It depends on the surface we’re painting.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Over the last several years, we’ve not performed any brush and roll only jobs. Brush and roll only takes
          considerably longer and is therefore considerably more expensive. If you are thinking you’d like brush and
          roll only, talk to you estimator about why and we can always price it as an option for you.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Spray and backroll is necessary when the surface is porous (like an open grained wood) or dry (like stucco
          being painted for the first time). In order to provide a uniform finish that looks great, the paint needs to
          be pushed down into the pores. During your walkaround with your estimator, we’ll walk you through our painting
          process and point out where we’d recommend the surface be sprayed and backrolled and get your feedback or
          answer questions you might have.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Sprayers themselves haven’t changed much in the last 10 years but the tips they use have. Tips are now
          excellent at atomizing the paint (making a very fine mist) and delivering the paint to the painted surface
          reliably. We use Graco paint sprayers and they are high-tech, very expensive machines specifically designed to
          do what we’re doing as professional painters. Spraying produces the nicest looking finish, the most uniform
          coating, and when used by a professional painter gives the customer the highest quality product most
          efficiently. In the hands of an experienced paint crew, 1 pass with a sprayer over a properly prepared surface
          will produce a better coating than multiple passes with a brush and roller.
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">As Kansas City homeowners will painting increase my home's value?</h5>
        <p>
          Painting your home will enhance the appeal of your home to your neighbors. If you are thinking of reselling,
          then a new exterior paint job might make the difference in first impressions to potential buyers.
        </p>
        <h5 class="upper left">how much does a painting project cost?</h5>
        <p>
          This varies widely based on home, condition, what you want, etc…Our average exterior job cost in 2022 was
          around $8,200. This average includes all materials, prep work, painting work and often wood rot repairs.
          Smaller homes we work on can be between $3k and $4k and larger homes we’ve worked on can be $20k or more.
