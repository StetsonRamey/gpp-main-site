Brush and roll only takes considerably longer and is therefore considerably more expensive. If you are thinking you’d like brush and roll only, talk to you estimator about why and we can always price it as an option for you.</p><p>Spray and backroll is necessary when the surface being painted is porous (like an open grained wood) or dry (like stucco being painted for the first time). In order to provide a uniform finish that looks great, the paint needs to be pushed down into the pores. During your walkaround with your estimator, we’ll point out where we’d recommend the surface be sprayed and backrolled and get your feedback or answer questions you might have.</p><p>Sprayers themselves haven’t changed much in the last 10 years but the tips they use have. Tips are now excellent at atomizing the paint (making a very fine mist) and delivering the paint to the painted surface reliably. We use Graco paint sprayers and they are high tech, very expensive machines specifically designed to do what we’re doing as professional painters. Spraying produces the nicest looking finish, the most uniform coating, and when used by a professional painter gives the customer the highest quality product most efficiently. In the hands of experienced painters, 1 pass with a sprayer over a properly prepared surface will produce a better coating than multiple passes with a brush and roller.</p>"
