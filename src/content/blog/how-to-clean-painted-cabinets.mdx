There's nothing like a freshly painted kitchen to brighten up your home. But all that cooking and entertaining can leave your cabinets looking less than stellar. Luckily, with a little elbow grease and the right cleaning supplies, you can get them looking like new again. Here are a few simple steps you can follow to clean your painted cabinets:


## Step 1: Remove All of the Items from Your Cabinets

Like with any cleaning project, the first step in cleaning painted cabinets is to remove all of the clutter. Removing all of the items from your cabinets will give you a chance to clean both the inside and outside of the cabinets, as well as the hardware. In addition, it will allow you to inspect the condition of your cabinets before proceeding with the cleaning process.


## Step 2: Assemble Your Cleaning Supplies and Prepare Your Cleaning Solution

Once you've removed all the items from your cabinets, it's time to gather your cleaning supplies. You'll need a bucket, dish soap, water, white vinegar, baking soda and at least 3 microfiber cloths.

In the bucket, mix three cups of warm water, one cup of white vinegar, two teaspoons of dish soap and three tablespoons of baking soda. Wait until the baking soda dissolves and then transfer part of the solution in a spray bottle.


## Step 3: Address the Stains on the Cabinets

Now that your cleaning solution is mixed and microfiber cloths are on hand, it's time to start spraying down the cabinets. Here's how to go about it:



* Begin by spraying the cleaning solution onto the cabinets. If the cabinets are extremely dirty, you may need to let the cleaning solution sit for a few minutes before wiping it away. Be sure to work in small sections so that the solution doesn't have a chance to dry out before you wipe it away.
* Next, use one of the microfiber cloths to wipe away the cleaning solution. Make sure to go with the wood grain to avoid damaging the paint job. Be sure to work in a circular motion and don't press too hard lest you damage the cabinet.
* Rinse the cloth frequently in clean water to avoid spreading dirt and grime around. Repeat this process until all of the dirt and grime has been removed from the cabinets. You may need to go over particularly stubborn stains multiple times.
* Once you've wiped down all the surfaces, use a second microfiber cloth to buff the cabinets dry.
* Additional Tips to Help You Maintain Your Painted Cabinets in Pristine Conditions


### Use An Old Toothbrush To Tackle Tight Spots

Tight spots and corners can be difficult to clean with a cloth or sponge. An old toothbrush is the perfect tool for getting into those tricky areas. Simply dip the bristles in your cleaning solution and scrub away. For best results, use a toothbrush with soft bristles to avoid damaging the finish on your cabinets.


### Don’t Forget The Hardware

The handles and knobs on your kitchen cabinets can get just as dirty as the rest of the surface. To clean them, simply remove them from the cabinets and soak them in soapy water for a few minutes. Then, scrub them with a toothbrush or other stiff brush before rinsing them off and drying them thoroughly. If your hardware is particularly dirty, you may need to use a metal polish to get it sparkling clean.


### Don’t Soak the Cabinet

While part of cleaning painted cabinets involves getting rid of built-up grime, you don't want to soak your cabinets and cause water damage. At the same time, don’t let the water run into the hinges. Water can cause the hinges to rust, which will damage the cabinets and make them more difficult to open and close. In addition, water can also cause the paint to blister and peel.


### Don’t Use Anything Abrasive on the Glass

If your cabinet has glass doors, you'll want to take extra care to avoid scratching or harming the surface. Always use a soft, lint-free cloth when dusting or cleaning the glass, and avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. If there are stubborn smudges or fingerprints, you can try using a vinegar solution or window cleaner. Just be sure to rinse the surface well afterwards to avoid damaging the finish.


### Test Cleaners In An Inconspicuous Spot

It's always a good idea to test any cleaner on a small area before using it on the entire cabinet. This will help you ensure that the cleaner won't damage the paint or finish. Simply apply a small amount of cleaner to a cotton ball and wipe it on a hidden spot on the cabinet. If there is no visible damage after a few minutes, then it should be safe to use on the rest of the cabinet.

As you can see, cleaning and maintaining painted cabinets is not as difficult as it may seem. By following the proper steps and using the right cleaning products, you can keep your cabinets looking like new for years to come.
