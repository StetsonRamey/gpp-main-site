desc: What are the best interior colors for open floor plans?
---

Gone are the days when closed floor plans were the only option for home design. In recent years, open floor plans have become increasingly popular, as they provide a sense of spaciousness, and allow for more flexibility and flow between living spaces. In this article, we will explore some of the best color schemes for open floor plans, to help you create a beautiful and cohesive space in your home.

## Light and Natural Color Scheme

One of the most popular color schemes for open floor plans is a light and natural color scheme. This color scheme typically involves using light and neutral colors on the walls and floors, such as white, cream, or beige. These colors help create a sense of openness and airiness in the space and can make the room feel larger, homier, and cozy.

The light and natural color scheme palette are versatile, meaning it can be easily dressed up or down depending on the occasion. This color scheme is a great fit for home designs that are modern, minimalist, or have a coastal or farmhouse aesthetic. It’s also well-suited to homes with plenty of natural light and can help enhance the connection between indoor and outdoor spaces.

## Rich Earth Tones

A rich, earth-tone scheme is particularly well-suited to homes with an open floor plan because common rich earth tones such as deep brown, warm tan, and rustic red can help visually connect the different areas of the home, making it feel more cohesive and inviting.

You can also pair these colors with natural materials like wood and stone for a look that feels grounded and organic. This color scheme works well in a variety of home designs, including traditional and modern styles.

## Cherry Tones

Another great open floor plan color scheme is cherry tones. The cherry tones create a sense of luxury and elegance and can be paired with neutral colors like beige or cream for a sophisticated look, or with bold accent colors like gold or silver for added drama.

This color scheme is ideal for homeowners who want to create a bold, warm, and conversation-worthy space. It speaks of sophistication and can easily be incorporated into a wide range of home designs, from traditional to modern. _For example, cherry tones could be used on the walls, paired with beige carpet and cream furniture for a classic and elegant look, or combined with gold accents and modern furniture for a more contemporary feel._

## Gray Undertones

Are you looking to add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your home without overwhelming the space? Consider using gray undertones. This color scheme is perfect for a modern or contemporary home design and would add a chic and sophisticated touch to any space. Plus, it's easy to find a wide range of gray paint options at any local home improvement store, making it a budget-friendly choice.

The best part about this color scheme is that it's versatile, and could be dressed up or down depending on the desired aesthetic. For a more formal look, consider using a dark charcoal gray as the main color and pairing it with a light beige or cream. Alternatively, for a more relaxed and casual vibe, opt for a softer, warmer gray and pair it with a light taupe or mushroom color.

## Think About the Overall Design Style

When choosing a color palette for an open floor plan, it's important to consider the overall design style of the space. This will help ensure that the colors you choose complement and enhance the overall aesthetic of the room. To determine the design style of your space, think about the architectural features of the room, the furniture and decor you have, and the overall vibe you want to create.

Some common design styles include modern, minimalist, farmhouse, and mid-century modern styles. Once you have a sense of the design style, you can start to consider color options that will fit well with that aesthetic.

_For example, if you have a modern space with sleek, clean lines, you may want to choose a color palette that features bold, vibrant colors or monochromatic hues. On the other hand, if you have a farmhouse-style space with rustic elements, you may want to choose a color palette that features warm, earthy tones._

### Consider the Size of the Space

Larger rooms can handle bolder and darker colors, while smaller rooms may benefit from lighter and softer shades.

### Use a Color Wheel to Help You Choose Colors That Complement Each Other

A color wheel can help you see which colors work well together, and can help you choose a palette that is both harmonious and visually appealing.

### Take Into Account the Lighting

The lighting in a room can greatly affect how the colors look. Generally, natural light can make colors appear more vibrant, while artificial light can make them look duller.

### Test Out Your Colors Before Committing

Before you paint your walls or choose your furniture, it's a good idea to test out your color palette to see how it looks in your space. You can do this by creating samples of your chosen colors and placing them in different areas of your open floor plan. This will give you a good idea of how the colors will look in the space and whether you need to make any adjustments.

### Don’t Be Afraid to Mix and Match

While you want to create a cohesive look, that doesn't mean you have to stick to just one or two colors. Mixing and matching different colors can add visual interest and depth to your open floor plan. Just be sure to choose colors that complement each other and work well together.

### FAQs About Open Floor Plan Color Schemes:

#### How Do You Transition Colors in an Open Floor Plan?

To transition colors in an open floor plan, you can use a combination of wall colors, area rugs, and decorative items to create a cohesive look. For example, you could paint the walls in one area a different color from the walls in another area, and use an area rug to tie the two spaces together. Alternatively, you could use a neutral wall color throughout the space and use different colored furniture and decorative items to create a color scheme.

#### Should an Open Floor Plan Be Painted the Same Color?

Whether an open floor plan should be painted the same color or not depends on the overall aesthetic you are trying to achieve. Some people prefer to use a single color throughout the space to create a cohesive and harmonious look, while others prefer to use different colors to define different areas and create a more dynamic and interesting space. Ultimately, the decision is up to you and what you think will work best in your space.

#### Can You Paint Open Plan Different Colors?

Yes, you can paint an open floor plan in different colors. As mentioned above, using different colors can help define different areas within the open space and create a more interesting and dynamic look. However, it is important to choose colors that complement each other and work well together to create a cohesive overall color scheme.
